 * Packet server.
 * The hosting module has to be compiled with both the packet.c and the
 * packet_server.c source files. To function correctly, initialization of the
 * packet map by the pm_init() function has to happen at the first place. Then
 * the packet messages have to be processed by the packet_server_message()
 * function. The packet map should be released by the pm_destroy() function
 * during the module termination.
