 * To function correctly, initialization of the packet map by the pm_init()
 * function has to happen at the first place. The module should not send the
 * packet messages to the packet server but use the functions provided. The
 * packet map should be released by the pm_destroy() function during the module
 * termination. The packets and the packet queues can't be locked at all. The
 * processing modules should process them sequentially - by passing the packets
 * to the next module and stopping using the passed ones.
