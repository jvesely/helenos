	  submitted by Jim Wilson

	* added patch to discard unwind sections, newer toolchains
	  complained about them. Patch submitted by Jesse Barnes from SGI.

2003-09-29  Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>
	* updated elf_ia64_efi.lds to reflect new data sections 
	  created by gcc-3.3. Patch provided by Andreas Schwab from Suse.

2003-06-20  Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>
	* updated elf_ia64_efi.lds and elf_ia32_efi.lds to include
	  new types data sections produced by recent version of gcc-3.x

2002-02-22  Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>
	* release 3.0a
	* modified both IA-64 and IA-32 loader scripts to add support for the
	  new .rodata sections names (such as rodata.str2.8). Required
	  for new versions of gcc3.x.

2001-06-20  Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>
	* release 3.0
	* split gnu-efi package in two different packages: the libary+include+crt and the bootloader.
	* removed W2U() hack and related files to get from wide-char to unicode. 
	* Use -fshort-wchar option for unicode.
	* restructured Makefiles now install under INSTALLROOT.

2001-04-06  Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>

	* incorporated patches from David and Michael Johnston at Intel
	  to get the package to compile for IA-32 linux target.

	* Fixed ELILO to compile for Ia-32 (does not execute yet, though):
	  Makefile and start_kernel() function.

2001-04-06  Andreas Schwab <schwab@suse.de>

	* Fixed config.c  to
	  get the timeout directive to do something. implemented the global
	  root= directive.

	* Fix the efi_main() to deal with the -C option properly

2001-04-05  Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>

	* update efi library to latest EFI toolkit 1.02 as distributed
	  by Intel. Fixed header + library files to compile with GCC

	* merged ELI and LILO (as of gnu-efi-1.1) together, mostly
	  taking the config file feature of ELI.

	* renamed LILO to ELILO to make the distinction

	* restructured code to make it easier to understand and maintain

	* fixed FPSWA driver checking and loading: we try all possible
	  files and let the driver itself figure out if it is the most
	  recent.
	* added support for compression (gzip) but keep support for plain
	  ELF image. ELILO autodetects the format

	* change the way the kernel is invoked. Now we call it in 
	  physical memory mode. This breaks the dependency between the
	  kernel code and the loader. No more lilo_start.c madness.

	* changed the way the boot_params are passed. We don't use the 
	  ZERO_PAGE_ADDR trick anymore. Instead we use EFI runtime memory.
	  The address of the structure is passed to the kernel in r28
	  by our convention.

	* released as gnu-efi-2.0

2001-04-03  David Mosberger  <davidm@hpl.hp.com>

	* gnuefi/reloc_ia32.c (_relocate): Change return type from "void"
	to "int".  Return error status if relocation fails for some
	reason.

	* gnuefi/elf_ia32_efi.lds: Drop unneeded ".rel.reloc" section.

	* gnuefi/crt0-efi-ia32.S (_start): Exit if _relocate() returns with
	non-zero exit status.

	* inc/ia32/efibind.h [__GNUC__]: Force 8-byte alignment for 64-bit
	types as that is what EFI appears to be expecting, despite the
	"#pragma pack()" at the beginning of the file!

2001-03-29  David Mosberger  <davidm@hpl.hp.com>

	* gnuefi/reloc_ia32.c: Add a couple of defines to work around
	libc/efilib collision on uint64_t et al.
	(_relocate): Use ELF32_R_TYPE() instead of ELFW(R_TYPE)().

	* gnuefi/crt0-efi-ia32.S (dummy): Add a dummy relocation entry.

2001-03-29  David Mosberger  <davidm@hpl.hp.com>

        * gnuefi/reloc_ia32.c: Add a couple of defines to work around
        libc/efilib collision on uint64_t et al.
        (_relocate): Use ELF32_R_TYPE() instead of ELFW(R_TYPE)().

        * gnuefi/crt0-efi-ia32.S (dummy): Add a dummy relocation entry.

2000-10-26  David Mosberger  <davidm@hpl.hp.com>
 
 	* gnuefi/elf_ia64_efi.lds: Mention .rela.sdata.
 
 	* Make.defaults (CFLAGS): Remove -nostdinc flags so we can pick
 	up the C compiler's stdarg.h.
 
 	* inc/stdarg.h: Remove this file.  It's not correct for gcc (nor
 	most other optimizing compilers).

2000-10-10  Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>

	* cleaned up the error message and printing of those.
	* added support to load the FPSWA from a file in case support is not
	  present in the firmware already
	* fixed split_args() to do the right thing when you have leading spaces
	  before kernel name
	* changed the argify() function to rely on \0 instead of LoadOptionSize
	  as the field seems to be broken with current firmware
	* bumped version to 1.0

2000-10-04  David Mosberger  <davidm@hpl.hp.com>
 
	* gnuefi/reloc_ia64.S: Reserve space for up to 750 function descriptors.

	* gnuefi/elf_ia64_efi.lds: Add .sdata section for small data and
	put __gp in the "middle" of it.

	* gnuefi/crt0-efi-ia64.S (_start): Use movl/add to load
	gp-relative addresses that could be out of the range of the addl
	offset.
	* gnuefi/reloc_ia64.S (_relocate): Ditto.

	* apps/Makefile: Remove standard rules and include Make.rules instead.
	* lilo/Makefile: Ditto.

	* Make.rules: New file.

2000-08-04  Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>
	* released version 0.9
	* incorporated ACPI changes for Asuza by NEC < kouchi@hpc.bs1.fc.nec.co.jp>
	* added support for initrd (-i option) original ELI code from Bill Nottingham <notting@redhat.com>)
	* lots of cleanups 
	* got rid of #ifdef LILO_DEBUG and uses macro instead
	* fix a few extra memory leaks in create_boot_params()
	* added exit capability just before starting the kernel

2000-06-22  David Mosberger  <davidm@hpl.hp.com>

	* gnuefi/elf_ia64_efi.lds: Add .srodata, .ctors, .IA64.unwind,
	.IA64.unwind_info to .data section and .rela.ctors to .rela
	section.

2000-04-03  David Mosberger  <davidm@hpl.hp.com>

	* lilo/lilo.c (LILO_VERSION): Up version number to 0.9.

	* gnuefi/elf_ia64_efi.lds: Include .IA_64.unwind and
	.IA_64.unwind_info in .data segment to avoid EFI load error
	"ImageAddress: pointer outside of image" error due to the .dynsym
	relocations against these sections.

	* ChangeLog: Moved from lilo/ChangeLogs.

	* gnuefi/reloc_ia64.S: fixed typo: .space directive had constant
	100 hardcoded instead of using MAX_FUNCTION_DESCRIPTORS
	macro. Duh.

Fri Mar 17 15:19:18 PST 2000 Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>

	* Released 0.8
	* replace the  getopt.c with new version free with better license
	* created a documentation file
	* fix a couple of memory leaks
	* code cleanups
	* created a separate directory for lilo in the gnu-efi package.
	* added support for the BOOT_IMAGE argument to kernel
	* default is to build natively now
