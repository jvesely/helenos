 * @brief Scalable resizable concurrent lock-free hash table.
 * 
 * CHT is a concurrent hash table that is scalable resizable and lock-free.
 * resizable = the number of buckets of the table increases or decreases
 *     depending on the average number of elements per bucket (ie load)
 * scalable = accessing the table from more cpus increases performance
 *     almost linearly
 * lock-free = common operations never block; even if any of the operations
 *     is preempted or interrupted at any time, other operations will still
 *     make forward progress
 *
 * CHT is designed for read mostly scenarios. Performance degrades as the
 * fraction of updates (insert/remove) increases. Other data structures
 * significantly outperform CHT if the fraction of updates exceeds ~40%.
 * 
 * CHT tolerates hardware exceptions and may be accessed from exception
 * handlers as long as the underlying RCU implementation is exception safe.
 * 
 * @par Caveats
 * 
 * 0) Never assume an item is still in the table.
 * The table may be accessed concurrently; therefore, other threads may
 * insert or remove an item at any time. Do not assume an item is still
 * in the table if cht_find() just returned it to you. Similarly, an
 * item may have already been inserted by the time cht_find() returns NULL.
 * 
 * 1) Always use RCU read locks when searching the table.
 * Holding an RCU lock guarantees that an item found in the table remains
 * valid (eg is not freed) even if the item was removed from the table
 * in the meantime by another thread.
 * 
 * 2) Never update values in place.
 * Do not update items in the table in place, ie directly. The changes
 * will not propagate to other readers (on other cpus) immediately or even
 * correctly. Some readers may then encounter items that have only some
 * of their fields changed or are completely inconsistent. 
 * 
 * Instead consider inserting an updated/changed copy of the item and 
 * removing the original item. Or contact the maintainer to provide
 * you with a function that atomically replaces an item with a copy.
 * 
 * 3) Use cht_insert_unique() instead of checking for duplicates with cht_find()
 * The following code is prone to race conditions:
 * @code
 * if (NULL == cht_find(&h, key)) {
 *     // If another thread inserts and item here, we'll insert a duplicate.
 *     cht_insert(&h, item);
 * }
 * @endcode
 * See cht_insert_unique() on how to correctly fix this.
 * 
 *
 * @par Semantics
 * 
 * Lazy readers = cht_find_lazy(), cht_find_next_lazy()
 * Readers = lazy readers, cht_find(), cht_find_next()
 * Updates = cht_insert(), cht_insert_unique(), cht_remove_key(), 
 *     cht_remove_item()
 * 
 * Readers (but not lazy readers) are guaranteed to see the effects 
 * of @e completed updates. In other words, if cht_find() is invoked 
 * after a cht_insert() @e returned eg on another cpu, cht_find() is 
 * guaranteed to see the inserted item. 
 * 
 * Similarly, updates see the effects of @e completed updates. For example,
 * issuing cht_remove() after a cht_insert() for that key returned (even 
 * on another cpu) is guaranteed to remove the inserted item.
 * 
 * Reading or updating the table concurrently with other updates
 * always returns consistent data and never corrupts the table.
 * However the effects of concurrent updates may or may not be
 * visible to all other concurrent readers or updaters. Eg, not
 * all readers may see that an item has already been inserted 
 * if cht_insert() has not yet returned. 
 * 
 * Lazy readers are guaranteed to eventually see updates but it
 * may take some time (possibly milliseconds) after the update
 * completes for the change to propagate to lazy readers on all
 * cpus.
 * 
 * @par Implementation
 * 
 * Collisions in CHT are resolved with chaining. The number of buckets
 * is always a power of 2. Each bucket is represented with a single linked 
 * lock-free list [1]. Items in buckets are sorted by their mixed hashes 
 * in ascending order. All buckets are terminated with a single global 
 * sentinel node whose mixed hash value is the greatest possible. 
 *
 * CHT with 2^k buckets uses the k most significant bits of a hash value
 * to determine the bucket number where an item is to be stored. To
 * avoid storing all items in a single bucket if the user supplied
 * hash function does not produce uniform hashes, hash values are
 * mixed first so that the top bits of a mixed hash change even if hash
 * values differ only in the least significant bits. The mixed hash 
 * values are cached in cht_link.hash (which is overwritten once the 
 * item is scheduled for removal via rcu_call).
 * 
 * A new item is inserted before all other existing items in the bucket
 * with the same hash value as the newly inserted item (a la the original
 * lock-free list [2]). Placing new items at the start of a same-hash 
 * sequence of items (eg duplicates) allows us to easily check for duplicates 
 * in cht_insert_unique(). The function can first check that there are 
 * no duplicates of the newly inserted item amongst the items with the 
 * same hash as the new item. If there were no duplicates the new item 
 * is linked before the same-hash items. Inserting a duplicate while 
 * the function is checking for duplicates is detected as a change of 
 * the link to the first checked same-hash item (and the search for 
 * duplicates can be restarted).
 * 
 * @par Table resize algorithm
 * 
 * Table resize is based on [3] and [5]. First, a new bucket head array
 * is allocated and initialized. Second, old bucket heads are moved
 * to the new bucket head array with the protocol mentioned in [5]. 
 * At this point updaters start using the new bucket heads. Third,
 * buckets are split (or joined) so that the table can make use of
 * the extra bucket head slots in the new array (or stop wasting space
 * with the unnecessary extra slots in the old array). Splitting
 * or joining buckets employs a custom protocol. Last, the new array 
 * replaces the original bucket array.
 * 
 * A single background work item (of the system work queue) guides
 * resizing of the table. If an updater detects that the bucket it
 * is about to access is undergoing a resize (ie its head is moving
 * or it needs to be split/joined), it helps out and completes the
 * head move or the bucket split/join.
 * 
 * The table always grows or shrinks by a factor of 2. Because items 
 * are assigned a bucket based on the top k bits of their mixed hash 
 * values, when growing the table each bucket is split into two buckets 
 * and all items of the two new buckets come from the single bucket in the 
 * original table. Ie items from separate buckets in the original table
 * never intermix in the new buckets. Moreover 
 * since the buckets are sorted by their mixed hash values the items 
 * at the beginning of the old bucket will end up in the first new 
 * bucket while all the remaining items of the old bucket will end up
 * in the second new bucket. Therefore, there is a single point where 
 * to split the linked list of the old bucket into two correctly sorted 
 * linked lists of the new buckets:
 *                            .- bucket split
 *                            | 
 *             <-- first -->  v  <-- second --> 
 *   [old] --> [00b] -> [01b] -> [10b] -> [11b] -> sentinel
 *              ^                 ^    
 *   [new0] -- -+                 |  
 *   [new1] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -+
 * 
 * Resize in greater detail:
 * 
 * a) First, a resizer (a single background system work queue item 
 * in charge of resizing the table) allocates and initializes a new 
 * bucket head array. New bucket heads are pointed to the sentinel 
 * and marked Invalid (in the lower order bits of the pointer to the 
 * next item, ie the sentinel in this case):
 * 
 *   [old, N] --> [00b] -> [01b] -> [10b] -> [11b] -> sentinel
 *                                                    ^ ^
 *   [new0, Inv] -------------------------------------+ |
 *   [new1, Inv] ---------------------------------------+
 * 
 * 
 * b) Second, the resizer starts moving old bucket heads with the following 
 * lock-free protocol (from [5]) where cas(variable, expected_val, new_val) 
 * is short for compare-and-swap:
 * 
 *   old head     new0 head      transition to next state
 *   --------     ---------      ------------------------
 *   addr, N      sentinel, Inv  cas(old, (addr, N), (addr, Const))
 *                               .. mark the old head as immutable, so that 
 *                                  updaters do not relink it to other nodes 
 *                                  until the head move is done.
 *   addr, Const  sentinel, Inv  cas(new0, (sentinel, Inv), (addr, N))
 *                               .. move the address to the new head and mark 
 *                                  the new head normal so updaters can start
 *                                  using it.
 *   addr, Const  addr, N        cas(old, (addr, Const), (addr, Inv))
 *                               .. mark the old head Invalid to signify
 *                                  the head move is done.
 *   addr, Inv    addr, N
 * 
 * Notice that concurrent updaters may step in at any point and correctly
 * complete the head move without disrupting the resizer. At worst, the
 * resizer or other concurrent updaters will attempt a number of CAS() that 
 * will correctly fail.
 * 
 *   [old, Inv] -> [00b] -> [01b] -> [10b] -> [11b] -> sentinel
 *                 ^                                   ^
 *   [new0, N] ----+                                   |
 *   [new1, Inv] --------------------------------------+
 * 
 *  
 * c) Third, buckets are split if the table is growing; or joined if 
 * shrinking (by the resizer or updaters depending on whoever accesses 
 * the bucket first). See split_bucket() and join_buckets() for details.
 * 
 *  1) Mark the last item of new0 with JOIN_FOLLOWS:
 *   [old, Inv] -> [00b] -> [01b, JF] -> [10b] -> [11b] -> sentinel
 *                 ^                                       ^
 *   [new0, N] ----+                                       |
 *   [new1, Inv] ------------------------------------------+
 * 
 *  2) Mark the first item of new1 with JOIN_NODE:
 *   [old, Inv] -> [00b] -> [01b, JF] -> [10b, JN] -> [11b] -> sentinel
 *                 ^                                           ^
 *   [new0, N] ----+                                           |
 *   [new1, Inv] ----------------------------------------------+
 * 
 *  3) Point new1 to the join-node and mark new1 NORMAL.
 *   [old, Inv] -> [00b] -> [01b, JF] -> [10b, JN] -> [11b] -> sentinel
 *                 ^                     ^
 *   [new0, N] ----+                     |
 *   [new1, N] --------------------------+
 * 
 * 
 * d) Fourth, the resizer cleans up extra marks added during bucket 
 * splits/joins but only when it is sure all updaters are accessing
 * the table via the new bucket heads only (ie it is certain there
 * are no delayed updaters unaware of the resize and accessing the 
 * table via the old bucket head).
 * 
 *   [old, Inv] ---+
 *                 v
 *   [new0, N] --> [00b] -> [01b, N] ---+
 *                                      v
 *   [new1, N] --> [10b, N] -> [11b] -> sentinel
 * 
 * 
 * e) Last, the resizer publishes the new bucket head array for everyone
 * to see and use. This signals the end of the resize and the old bucket
 * array is freed. 
 * 
 * 
 * To understand details of how the table is resized, read [1, 3, 5]
 * and comments in join_buckets(), split_bucket().

	 * completed the move before cpu1 gets a chance to notice cpu2
	 * had already completed the move. Our requirements for cas()

	 * after issuing a load memory barrier once it has determined 
	 * the old_head's value had been successfully moved to new_head
